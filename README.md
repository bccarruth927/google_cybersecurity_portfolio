# Google Cybersecurity Portfolio

My collection of projects completed throughout the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification program. These documents demonstrate many of the skills and foundational
knowledge I developed while completing the certification courses. Skills include proficiency in Python and SQL, fundamental knowledge of network architecture and network security
controls and hardening practices, understanding of security frameworks like NIST and the CIA Triad.
